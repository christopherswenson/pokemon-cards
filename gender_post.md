# Unequal Gender Representation in Depictions of Pokémon in the TCG 

A light-hearted but in-depth examination of which Pokémon in the Trading Card Game can be found as both male and female.

Over the years playing the Pokémon video games, I have cultivated a "Living Dex,"  a collection of one of every Pokémon. Specifically, I have an All (Non-Shiny) Forms OT Living Dex, which means I not only have one of every Pokémon, but one of each form of each Pokémon (not including shinies), including all 63 forms of Alcremie, all 28 Unown, etc., as well as both genders of all Pokémon that exhibit gender differences; and the "OT" part means that wherever it's possible, I personally caught the Pokémon, rather than receiving it in a trade.

_Note: throughout the article, when I say "gender differences," I'm referring to sexual dimorphism, where males and females have different appearances, which is something that is canonical in the Pokémon world and can be observed in real-life animals as well._ 

With that project done, at least until Gen X, I've started to embark on a new project to have an All Forms Living Dex of _Pokémon cards_. But, what does that really mean? Are there cards for every different form of every different Pokémon? Well, the answer turns out to be "it depends." There are _not_, for example, 63 different forms of Alcremie depicted, but there _are_ all 28 Unown forms. Only Red Core Minior are depicted on their own, but one full-art Minior form shows all the different colors.

In doing research for this project, I also looked at gender differences. I was not that surprised to find very little information about this online. I've included the two links I could find at the bottom of this article. Both are questions with one response and very little to go on. Pokémon with gender differences come in three broad categories.

1. Pokémon with prominent gender differences that are core to their design, like Pyroar

2. Pokémon with minor gender differences that are still easily distinguishable if you know what to look for, like Magikarp

3. Pokémon with gender differences that are just about some feature being smaller or larger, or in a slightly different position, like Rattata

For the last category, because of stylistic differences and perspective, it's nearly impossible to tell by looking at the cards whether the individual Pokémon are male or female. For the first category, the ones that regular Pokémon fans (not crazies like me) would instantly tell apart, there's a pretty even mix of cases where both genders are available as separate cards, cases where only one gender is available (or there's only one or two cards with the opposite gender), and even a couple cases where almost every card has both genders depicted. For the second category, where the casual collector wouldn't notice the difference, in almost every case one gender is preferred over the other, with no clear correlation to the canonical gender ratios found in the mainline games. In the vast majority of cases, that preferred gender is male.

It is clear to me that The Pokémon Company, and perhaps even Wizards of the Coast (who published Pokémon cards from December 1998 to July 2003 in the US) have fairly set in stone guidelines for which forms and genders are depicted and which are not. Otherwise, we would expect to see an even mix across the board of male versus female Pokémon. For form variations in a single set, I can easily comprehend why one or two forms are favored over designing and printing a separate card for every form variation. In the extreme case, that would mean 63 different Alcremie cards. For context, the first set that included Alcremie was Rebel Clash, which had 209 cards. Having 63 Alcremie would mean almost a quarter (23%) of the cards in the set would be the same Pokémon. If all cards were equally likely to appear, that would mean the odds of _not_ getting an Alcremie in your 10-card pack would be around 7%. Clearly not a good idea. Across sets, however, I think it would be great if they mixed up available forms more, as it would give avid collectors another thing to get excited about.

But for gender variations, I really see no reason why one should be favored over the other. You might argue that if there's a mix of male and female cards, it might be a bit odd if your male Pikachu evolved into a female Raichu--and it would be cumbersome (and maybe somewhat politically contentious) to add a rule against doing so--but I'll simply refer you to the case of Doduo and Dodrio, where all depicted Doduo are male, and all Dodrio are female (apart from one shiny Dodrio)!

In any case, below I have documented all my findings in (excruciating) detail.

On methodology: for each Pokémon listed on Bulbapedia's list of gender differences in the mainline games, I searched pkmncards.com for the Pokémon's name, and looked through all the available cards. This means I have not accounted for cameos that appear in other cards, but if you find any that break the patterns that I've found, I would love to know about them and update my findings.

I'll group my summaries in each of the aforementioned categories, starting with the Pokémon with gender differences core to their design, and ending with the tedious size comparisons. In each category, I've ordered them by how interesting or surprising they are to me.

# The Obvious Ones

The ones I'm calling "obvious" are Combee, Hippopotas and Hippowdon, Unfezant, Frillish and Jellicent, Pyroar, Meowstic, Indeedee, Basculegion, Oinkologne, and of course the special case of Nidoran ♂ and Nidoran ♀. With this, there's no real pattern, and each case is different.

## Nidoran ♂ and Nidoran ♀

Since these are considered to be two different species, all cards specify either a ♂ or ♀, and there's a pretty even distribution of both.

Male example: https://pkmncards.com/card/nidoran-male-151-mew-032/

Female example: https://pkmncards.com/card/nidoran-female-151-mew-029/

## Combee

> Male's lower face has no red mark
Only female Combee can evolve into Vespiquen

All the "prominent" Combee are female, though one card has some background Combee which are male. This makes sense, as it would be pretty awkward if your obviously male Combee evolved into a Vespiquen.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/combee-obsidian-flames-obf-008/
  
Male in background: https://pkmncards.com/card/combee-astral-radiance-asr-011/

## Hippopotas

> Female's color pattern is inverted

100% male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/hippopotas-evolving-skies-evs-084/

## Hippowdon

> Male's body is light brown and female's is bluish-gray

100% male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/hippowdon-astral-radiance-asr-080/

## Unfezant

> Male has a reddish-pink wattle with long extensions while the female has a curved feather on the back of her head. Male has a green underside and female has a brown underside.

Eight cards show male Unfezant, one card shows a female.
  
Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/unfezant-rebel-clash-rcl-145/
  
Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/unfezant-emerging-powers-epo-82/

## Frillish

> Male is blue, frowns, and has a ruffled collar, smooth, diamond-patterned tentacles, and one upper eyelash per eye. Female is pink, smiles, and has a bulbous collar, frilled tentacles, and one lower eyelash per eye. Males have a star-shaped head pattern and a stiff crown while females have a flower-shaped pattern and a limp crown.

Five of the six cards show both male and female, one card shows only male. Interestingly, the male is always in front of the female.

Male only: https://pkmncards.com/card/frillish-battle-styles-bst-041/
  
Both: https://pkmncards.com/card/frillish-phantom-forces-phf-20/

## Jellicent

> Body color, eyes, head pattern, and tentacle differences are much the same as with Frillish, but the female's eyes are now larger and have two eyelashes each. Males have a facial covering resembling a large mustache while females have one resembling a fluffy collar. Female has a heart-shaped mouth and the male's is hidden inside the "mustache." Males have a more overall "kingly" appearance, while females have a more overall "queenly" appearance.

Same deal as Frillish.

Male only: https://pkmncards.com/card/jellicent-battle-styles-bst-042/
  
Both: https://pkmncards.com/card/jellicent-phantom-forces-phf-21/

## Pyroar

> Male has a large mane shaped like the kanji character 大 ō (big or great) or 火 hi (fire), a stockier body, and half-brown front legs. Female has long, flowing hair similar to a ponytail and mostly-brown legs.

All but one of the cards depict a male Pyroar. One card depicts a female, and one full art card has two females in the background.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/pyroar-cosmic-eclipse-cec-37/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/pyroar-lost-thunder-lot-51/

Female in background: https://pkmncards.com/card/pyroar-paldea-evolved-pal-200/

## Meowstic

> Males are mostly blue with white highlights, the inverse of females. Male's eyes are green with light blue sclerae, while female's are red and yellow.

Five cards depict males, five cards depict females, one card depicts both.


Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/meowstic-surging-sparks-ssp-085/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/meowstic-silver-tempest-sit-082/

Both: https://pkmncards.com/card/meowstic-generations-gen-rc15/

## Indeedee

> Males have lowered eyes, a triangular mouth pointing upwards like a frown, and more black on their torso, made to resemble a suit. Females have wider eyes, a triangular mouth pointing downwards like a smile, and more white on their torso, made to resemble an apron.

Five cards depict males, eight cards depict females. 

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/indeedee-surging-sparks-ssp-093/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/indeedee-fusion-strike-fst-127/

## Basculegion

> Males have red accents, fierce-looking eyes, longer barbels, and two additional growths on their chin resembling a stubble. Females have pale-blue accents, sad-looking eyes, shorter barbels, and additional accents around their lips and eyes.

All three Basculegion cards depict males.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/hisuian-basculegion-lost-origin-lor-045/

## Oinkologne

> Females have more brown bodies while males have a darker gray complexion. Male Oinkologne have a larger left ear which often covers their left eye, and have a more magenta shade of pink for their hooves and snout. Male Oinkologne are also slightly plumper than the females, and have a differently shaped tail bobble.

Three females (including a shiny, and two cards with the same art), and four males.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/oinkologne-obsidian-flames-obf-183/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/oinkologne-paldean-fates-paf-072/

# The Less-Obvious Ones

The less-obvious, but still clearly distinguishable ones for me are Pikachu and Raichu; Eevee; Doduo and Dodrio; Magikarp and Gyarados; Wobbuffet; Xatu; Wooper; Gloom and Vileplume; Torchic (but not Combusken or Blaziken); Bidoof and Bibarel; Shinx (but not Luxio or Luxray); Venusaur; Cacturne; Butterfree; Snover; Steelix; Heracross; Gible, Gabite and Garchomp; and Buizel and Floatzel.

In almost every case here, one gender is chosen over the other, with very rare exceptions. Of these, there are 20 with mostly male and 7 with mostly female.

## Pikachu

> Female's tail ends in the upper half of a heart

Every single Pikachu card depicts a Male Pikachu, or the tail is not entirely visible. There are a couple exceptions. In the Pikachu V-UNION card SWSH139, there is one female pikachu amongst all the males. In the Pikachu Libre XY Trainer Kit card, the tail is clearly female (this makes sense, because the cosplay Pikachu are all female in the games, though in the anime series, the Pikachu Libre and Rock Star Pikachu are males).

Clearly male: https://pkmncards.com/card/pikachu-evolving-skies-evs-049/

V-UNION: https://pkmncards.com/card/pikachu-v-union-sword-shield-promos-swsh139/

Libre: 
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/pikachu-libre-xy-trainer-kit-pikachu-libre-tk9p-30/
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/pikachu-libre-xy-trainer-kit-pikachu-libre-tk9p-14/

## Raichu

> Female's tail lacks a point and is smaller

All the Raichu are pretty clearly male, or don't show the tip of the tail.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/raichu-temporal-forces-tef-052/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/raichu-lost-origin-lor-053/

## Eevee

> Female's tail's white tip has larger, rounder scallops. This gender difference was introduced in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, where it was exclusive to the partner Eevee. Starting in Generation VIII, this gender difference was applied to all Eevee.

Not a single Eevee has large scallops on its tail. 

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/eevee-shrouded-fable-sfa-050/

## Doduo

> Male has black necks and female has beige necks

Very clearly all male, as they all have black necks.

  Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/doduo-unbroken-bonds-unb-150/

## Dodrio

> Male has black necks and female has beige necks

Interestingly, they're all female, except the Paldean Fates shiny one. I guess when you evolve your non-shiny Doduo it either becomes shiny or female.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/dodrio-paldean-fates-paf-200/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/dodrio-generations-gen-56/

## Magikarp

> Male has yellow whiskers and female has white whiskers

For all the ones where you can clearly discern the color 
of the whiskers, they are all yellow and therefore male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/magikarp-scarlet-violet-svi-044/

Maybe female: 
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/magikarp-151-mew-129/
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/magikarp-detective-pikachu-det-8/

## Gyarados

> Male has blue whiskers and female has white whiskers

Same as Magikarp, but blue. 

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/gyarados-pokemon-trading-card-game-classic-blastoise-clb-007/

## Wobbuffet

> Female's mouth has lipstick-like markings

There is exactly one card with a Wobbuffet with "lipstick."

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/wobbuffet-burning-shadows-bus-49/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/wobbuffet-generations-gen-rc11/

## Xatu

> Male has three body stripes

Every single Xatu has two stripes, so they're all female.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/xatu-paldean-fates-paf-026/

## Wooper

> Female has one set of gill branches

Every Wooper has two sets of gill branches.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/wooper-scarlet-violet-promos-svp-155/

## Gloom

> Female has one large spot per petal

Every single Gloom card has multiple spots per petal. 

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/gloom-obsidian-flames-obf-198/

## Vileplume

> Female's petals have larger spots

Every Vileplume (normal) is clearly male, with small spots. Both arts for the Vileplume GX are clearly female. The one Vileplume EX is unclear.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/vileplume-unbroken-bonds-unb-8/

Female GX: https://pkmncards.com/card/vileplume-gx-cosmic-eclipse-cec-211/

## Torchic

> Male has a black speck on his rear

Surprisingly, a couple of the Torchic actually are showing their tail feathers. For those that do, there is definitely no dot, so for the very few where it's possible to tell, they're female.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/torchic-power-keepers-pk-67/

Impossible to tell (most of them): https://pkmncards.com/card/torchic-mcdonalds-collection-2016-mcd16-2/


## Bidoof

> Male's tail has two additional curls

Since all the Bidoof are facing forward, it is somewhat difficult to tell, but none of them have any hint of extra tufts on their tail, so I want to call them all male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/bidoof-diamond-pearl-dp-70/

## Bibarel

> Male's mask has two additional curls

In contrast, none of the Bibarel (with one exception) have the extra tufts on their mask, making them all female. The one exception is the Pokemon Rumble Bibarel.

The one male: https://pkmncards.com/card/bibarel-rumble-rm-16/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/bibarel-primal-clash-prc-118/


## Shinx

> Female has blue hind feet and a shorter mane

None of them have blue on their hind feet, so they're all definitely male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/shinx-twilight-masquerade-twm-066/
  
## Venusaur 

> Female's flower has a visible gynoecium

None of the Venusaur's flowers have a visible gynoecium,
though in some, the flower is not completely visible.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/venusaur-ex-151-mew-198/

Maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/venusaur-shining-legends-slg-3/

## Cacturne

> Female has a large diamond on her chest where male has two small ones

These are very clearly all male, as none of them have a large central diamond.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/cacturne-plasma-freeze-plf-10/

## Butterfree 

> Female has black (purple in Generation V) spots on her lower wings

None of the cards depict a black spot on the wings.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/butterfree-151-mew-012/

## Snover

> Female's midsection is white

100% male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/snover-paldea-evolved-pal-010/

## Steelix

> Female lacks an outer tooth on each side

Every Steelix has two teeth on each side (or on the one side visible), making them all male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/steelix-paradox-rift-par-125/

## Heracross 

> Female's horn is heart-shaped

They're all male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/heracross-lost-thunder-lot-18/

## Gible

> Male has a notched dorsal fin

There are no visibly notched dorsal fins. All female.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/gible-ultra-prism-upr-97/

## Gabite

> Male has a notched dorsal fin

Again, no notched dorsal fins, all female.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/gabite-paradox-rift-par-095/

## Garchomp

> Male has a notched dorsal fin

For most of these, the dorsal fin is hard to see, but in the ones where it is visible, there is no notch, except for a Garchomp Spirit Link trainer card.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/garchomp-ultra-prism-upr-sv40/

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/garchomp-spirit-link-xy-promos-xyp-xy169/

## Buizel

> Female has one less light-colored spot on her back

There are four cards that show enough of the back to see at least one of the back stripes.

Definitely male: https://pkmncards.com/card/buizel-obsidian-flames-obf-048/

Maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/buizel-brilliant-stars-brs-038/

Given how far to the side it is, I want to assume there's another stripe that's not visible: 
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/buizel-ultra-prism-upr-35/
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/buizel-pop-series-9-p9-6/

## Floatzel

> Female has one less light-colored bump on her back

A fair number of the Floatzel are swimming with their backs visible, of these all of them are clearly male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/floatzel-ultra-prism-upr-36/

Even this one is male, since the bump is far on the left side, rather than centered: https://pkmncards.com/card/floatzel-gl-lv-x-rising-rivals-rr-104/

# The Extremely Subtle Ones

For all of the X is shorter/longer in the male/female, it's really
hard to tell; differing art style and perspective make it really hard to compare different cards. To the best of my ability, I have chosen examples of the biggest extremes in either direction (relative to other notable parts of the Pokémon's body) that I can find. 

## Rattata 

> Female has smaller whiskers

Some of them plausibly look female, others look definitely male.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/lt-surges-rattata-pokemon-trading-card-game-classic-blastoise-clb-015/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/rattata-151-mew-019/

## Raticate

> Female has smaller whiskers

These all look very male to me. 

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/lt-surges-raticate-pokemon-trading-card-game-classic-blastoise-clb-016/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/raticate-southern-islands-si-6/

## Zubat

> Female has smaller fangs

It is truly impossible to tell based on fang length.

Longest fangs (maybe male): https://pkmncards.com/card/zubat-sun-moon-trainer-kit-alolan-raichu-tk10a-11/

Shortest fangs (maybe female): https://pkmncards.com/card/zubat-unbroken-bonds-unb-64/

## Golbat

> Female has smaller fangs

Again, it's really not possible to be sure. 

Longest fangs (maybe male): https://pkmncards.com/card/golbat-unleashed-ul-30/

Shortest fangs (maybe female): https://pkmncards.com/card/golbat-delta-species-ds-43/

## Kadabra

> Female has a smaller mustache

It's not really possible to tell for sure, as it's once again a length thing, but they all look pretty male.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/kadabra-skyridge-sk-69/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/kadabra-twilight-masquerade-twm-081/

## Alakazam

> Female has a smaller mustache

Same as Kadabra, except that one card has a mustache that looks notably shorter. 

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/alakazam-twilight-masquerade-twm-082/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/alakazam-expedition-ex-33/

## Hypno

> Female has longer collar fur

It's really hard to tell. As far as I know it is not known canonically whether Sabrina's Hypno is male or female.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/hypno-pokemon-trading-card-game-classic-blastoise-clb-012/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/hypno-unbroken-bonds-unb-72/
  Sabrina's Hypno: https://pkmncards.com/card/sabrinas-hypno-gym-challenge-g2-56/

## Rhyhorn

> Female's horn is shorter

They mostly look pretty male to me.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/rhyhorn-diamond-pearl-dp-95/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/rhyhorn-hidden-legends-hl-70/

## Rhydon

> Female's horn is shorter

There's one or two that look like they could be female, but they mostly look male.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/rhydon-stellar-crown-scr-075/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/rhydon-hidden-legends-hl-46/

## Goldeen

> Female's horn is smaller

Very hard to tell. I think Misty's Goldeen looks like it could be female, but I'm not sure if it's canonically known.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/goldeen-151-mew-118/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/mistys-goldeen-gym-heroes-g1-85/

## Seaking

> Female's horn is smaller

Again, hard to tell.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/seaking-sword-shield-ssh-047/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/seaking-base-set-2-b2-60/

## Scyther

> Female's abdomen is larger

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/scyther-majestic-dawn-md-46/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/scyther-astral-radiance-asr-005/

## Meganium

> Male has longer antennae

Impossible to tell.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/meganium-call-of-legends-cl-27/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/meganium-expedition-ex-54/

## Ledyba

> Female has smaller antennae

Impossible to tell.

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/ledyba-mcdonalds-collection-2022-mcd22-1/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/ledyba-dragon-frontiers-df-53/

## Ledian

> Female has smaller antennae

They all look pretty distinctly male to me.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/ledian-xy-xy-7/

Shortest antennae, but still looks male to me: https://pkmncards.com/card/ledian-team-rocket-returns-tr-23/


## Sudowoodo

> Female's head "branch" is smaller

Most male-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/sudowoodo-lost-origin-lor-094/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/sudowoodo-paldea-evolved-pal-219/

## Politoed

> Female has smaller cheeks

They all have pretty big cheeks, so I'm going to call them all male.

Biggest cheeks: https://pkmncards.com/card/politoed-skyridge-sk-25/

Smallest cheeks: https://pkmncards.com/card/politoed-lost-origin-lor-032/

## Aipom

> Male has shorter head fur

Difficult to tell.

Shortest head fur (male): https://pkmncards.com/card/aipom-paradox-rift-par-211/

Longest head fur (female): https://pkmncards.com/card/aipom-twilight-masquerade-twm-137/

## Quagsire

> Female has a smaller dorsal ridge

Biggest dorsal ridge (male): https://pkmncards.com/card/quagsire-heartgold-soulsilver-hs-9/

Smallest dorsal ridge (female): https://pkmncards.com/card/quagsire-gl-rising-rivals-rr-76/

## Murkrow

> Female's hat-like plumage is smaller

These mostly look definitively male, though there are a couple older cards where the hat plumage looks a little smaller, but that could just be the design shifting over time.

Biggest hat: https://pkmncards.com/card/murkrow-scarlet-violet-promos-svp-021/

Smallest hat: https://pkmncards.com/card/murkrow-neo-revelation-n3-46/

## Girafarig

> Female's body has a larger yellow section

These all look male to me, judging by the position of the color change relative to the back spikes--the color shifts always around the second-to-last spike, whereas a female's color shift is partway through the last spike (see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/5vgyx3/female_vs_male_girafarig/).

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/girafarig-crown-zenith-crz-061/

Maybe possibly female: https://pkmncards.com/card/girafarig-lost-thunder-lot-94/

## Gligar

> Female has a smaller stinger

Biggest stinger: https://pkmncards.com/card/gligar-phantom-forces-phf-46/

Smallest stinger: https://pkmncards.com/card/gligar-guardians-rising-gri-67/

## Scizor 

> Female's abdomen is larger

Most male-looking (smallest red-to-black ratio on abdomen): https://pkmncards.com/card/scizor-crown-zenith-crz-086/

Most female-looking: https://pkmncards.com/card/scizor-ex-temporal-forces-tef-195/

## Sneasel

> Female's left ear is shorter

The Sneasel with the shortest left ear still looks more like a male than a female to me.

Longest left ear (male): https://pkmncards.com/card/sneasel-plasma-freeze-plf-65/

## Piloswine

Super hard to judge tusk-length, so I can't tell.

Longest tusks (male): https://pkmncards.com/card/piloswine-team-rocket-returns-tr-13/

Short head feathers: https://pkmncards.com/card/combusken-holon-phantoms-hp-39/

## Blaziken

> Female's head crest is smaller

It's hard to tell, but these all look male to me, given the proportion of the head crest; in all cases, it extends out to the same distance as the mask feathres.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/blaziken-darkness-ablaze-daa-024/

## Beautifly

> Male has longer red markings on his upper wings

You would think that this would be a size comparing situation, but all the Beautifly are pretty clearly female.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/beautifly-platinum-pl-21/

Maybe male: https://pkmncards.com/card/beautifly-dragons-exalted-drx-8/

## Dustox

> Female has smaller antennae

Truly impossible to tell.

Male or stylistic: https://pkmncards.com/card/dustox-lost-thunder-lot-28/

Coule be either, but smaller antennae: https://pkmncards.com/card/dustox-lost-origin-lor-010/

## Ludicolo

> Male has thicker stripes

These mostly look female to me, but there are a couple that look like they're male.

Male: 
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/ludicolo-nintendo-black-star-promos-020/
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/ludicolo-evolving-skies-evs-034/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/ludicolo-rebel-clash-rcl-009/

Small leaves: https://pkmncards.com/card/shiftry-rising-rivals-rr-13/

## Meditite

> Male's ears are higher

Most of these look female, as the ears are all positioned pretty low. Some of the older cards might be male.

Maybe male: https://pkmncards.com/card/meditite-hidden-legends-hl-66/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/meditite-silver-tempest-sit-072/

## Medicham

> Male has a larger bulb on his head

It is very difficult to tell.

Male, maybe: https://pkmncards.com/card/medicham-v-evolving-skies-evs-185/

Female, maybe: https://pkmncards.com/card/medicham-silver-tempest-sit-073/

## Roselia

> Female's body leaf is longer

There's definitely some variation in leaf length, probably enough that you could call some male and some female.

Short leaf (maybe male): 
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/roselia-unleashed-ul-61/
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/roselia-flashfire-flf-8/

Longest leaf (female): https://pkmncards.com/card/roselia-lost-origin-lor-014/

## Gulpin

> Female's feather is shorter

Completely impossible to tell; the variation in even the 3D models is very minor.

Longest: https://pkmncards.com/card/gulpin-celestial-storm-ces-57/

Shortest: https://pkmncards.com/card/gulpin-stellar-crown-scr-091/

## Swalot

> Female has shorter whiskers

All the Swalot have whiskers that look like they can reach their arms, so I want to call them all male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/swalot-stellar-crown-scr-092/

Possibly shorter, but also stylistic and still reach arms: https://pkmncards.com/card/swalot-phantom-forces-phf-38/

## Numel

> Female has larger hump

The variation in the reference models is very small, but I want to call these all female, because they all have humps that reach pretty far up the height of their heads.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/numel-paldean-fates-paf-011/

Shortest hump, conceivably male: https://pkmncards.com/card/numel-obsidian-flames-obf-031/

## Camerupt

> Female has larger humps

There's really no way to tell.
  
Smallest: https://pkmncards.com/card/camerupt-unified-minds-unm-24/

Largest: https://pkmncards.com/card/camerupt-paldean-fates-paf-012/

## Milotic

> Male's hair-like fins are shorter

Most Milotic look like their "hair" fins extend about halfway down the white section of their body, which is around what is indicated in the 3D models, making them female. There are a few that look a little shorter and could be male.

Maybe male: https://pkmncards.com/card/milotic-ex-surging-sparks-ssp-237/

Probably female: https://pkmncards.com/card/milotic-twilight-masquerade-twm-050/

## Relicanth

> Female has a shorter jaw guard

It appears there are some female and some male. Most Relicanth's jaw guards extend to the bottom of the jaw (female), while others extend below the jaw (male):

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/relicanth-temporal-forces-tef-084/

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/relicanth-ancient-origins-aor-23/
  
## Starly

> Female's forehead marking is smaller

Here I'm comparing the size of the white area on the top of the head to the white areas around the eyes. On all Starly cards, they are about the same size, making them male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/starly-scarlet-violet-svi-221/

Smallest top marking, possibly female: https://pkmncards.com/card/starly-brilliant-stars-brs-117/

## Staravia

> Female's forehead spot is smaller

Comparing the size of the grey circle to the white star, a couple look distinctly female, and a couple look distinctly male, but most are pretty ambiguous.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/staravia-plasma-freeze-plf-96/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/staravia-darkness-ablaze-daa-146/

## Staraptor

> Female's forehead spot is smaller

All of these have a pretty big white circle, so I want to call them all male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/staraptor-scarlet-violet-svi-150/

Maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/staraptor-brilliant-stars-brs-119/

## Kriketot

> Female has a larger collar

Some look distinctly female, where others look distinctly male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/kricketot-next-destinies-nxd-3/

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/kricketot-astral-radiance-asr-009/

## Kriketune

> Female has a smaller mustache

All the mustaches extend to the shoulder area, so I want to call them all male, except for two Kircketune V cards which look like they have short mustaches.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/kricketune-astral-radiance-asr-010/

Female: 
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/kricketune-v-battle-styles-bst-142/
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/kricketune-v-battle-styles-bst-006/

## Luxio

> Female has exposed rear ankles and a shorter mane

On all of them, the blue area on their hind paws extends only above the paw, not above the "ankle," so I'll also call them all male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/luxio-breakpoint-bkp-45/

## Luxray

> Female's mane is smaller

Most of them have manes that extend up about the same height as their head, making them female, but one or two Luxray V cards look like the mane extends a bit further, making them male.

Male:
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/luxray-v-astral-radiance-asr-050/
  - https://pkmncards.com/card/luxray-v-astral-radiance-asr-168/
  
Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/luxray-crown-zenith-crz-043/

## Roserade

> Female has longer cape

The difference in the 3D models is extremely small.
  
Short cape: https://pkmncards.com/card/roserade-lost-origin-lor-tg02/
  
Long cape: https://pkmncards.com/card/roserade-dragons-exalted-drx-14/

## Pachirisu

> Female's head stripe is shorter

On all but one card, it looks like the head stripe extends far enough down that I would call them male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/pachirisu-scarlet-violet-promos-svp-158/

Maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/pachirisu-call-of-legends-cl-18/

## Ambipom

> Male has shorter head fur

There's one card with shorter head fur that might be male.

Maybe male: https://pkmncards.com/card/ambipom-paradox-rift-par-146/
  
Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/ambipom-twilight-masquerade-twm-138/

## Croagunk

> Female has higher "bandages"

These are extremely difficult to tell. 

Maybe male: https://pkmncards.com/card/croagunk-majestic-dawn-md-60/

Maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/croagunk-boundaries-crossed-bcr-64/

## Toxicroak

> Female's vocal sac is smaller

Most of these have a big vocal sac, so I want to call them mostly male. There's one or two with a pretty small sac.

Biggest vocal sac: https://pkmncards.com/card/toxicroak-fusion-strike-fst-166/

Smallest vocal sac: https://pkmncards.com/card/toxicroak-boundaries-crossed-bcr-66/

## Finneon

> Female has larger bottom tail fins

They all have pretty big bottom tail fins. I'm calling them all female, but the difference is very small in any case.

Female: https://pkmncards.com/card/finneon-stellar-crown-scr-035/

## Lumineon

> Female has longer fins

Smallest fin: https://pkmncards.com/card/lumineon-unified-minds-unm-40/

Longest chest fur: https://pkmncards.com/card/abomasnow-paldea-evolved-pal-011/

## Weavile

> Female's ears are shorter

Most of these look male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/weavile-shrouded-fable-sfa-014/

Maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/weavile-plasma-freeze-plf-66/ 

## Rhyperior

> Female has smaller upper horn

Perspective makes this one really hard, but I have to say the upper horn on most of these looks pretty short, so I want to say mostly female.

Long upper horn (male): https://pkmncards.com/card/rhyperior-v-darkness-ablaze-daa-181/

Short male horn: https://pkmncards.com/card/rhyperior-lost-origin-lor-091/

## Tangrowth

> Female's finger markings are longer

These are almost certainly all male.

Male: https://pkmncards.com/card/tangrowth-twilight-masquerade-twm-002/

Longest finger markings, so maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/tangrowth-lv-x-arceus-ar-99/

## Mamoswine

> Female has smaller tusks

Perspective makes this really hard. Most of these look male to me.

Male probably: https://pkmncards.com/card/mamoswine-astral-radiance-asr-033/

Maybe female: https://pkmncards.com/card/mamoswine-plasma-storm-pls-28/
